You can set it up in your chromium browser of choice (Chrome, edge, etc.,) by

```console
git clone 
```
2. Navigate to *browser-name://extenstions*
3. Enable developer tools and click on **load unpackaged**
4. Select the directory

Feel free to make any changes for yourself and use the refresh button on the extensions page to render the changes
